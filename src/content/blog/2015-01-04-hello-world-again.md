Happy new year! I hope this year brings lots of awesome moments and that every reader here achieves their goals.

The domain change to torresmateo.com was finally successful, and I'm very happy about it. I made some visual changes to the blog, which I think are for the better.

Now, about what I've been doing for the last months. This is a summary divided by topics:

## Undergraduate Thesis

I'm happy to say that my thesis is halfway done. This thesis is about solving multi-dimensional optimisation problems using algorithms based on a particle swarm meta-heuristic. I'm currently on the implementation and experimentation part, which is exciting because I get to see results and compare them with other algorithms. I hope to finish by mid-year.

## Web Development Work

Work has been going well. The projects are interesting and I've learned a lot about different technologies. It's not my main passion, but it pays the bills and gives me valuable experience.

## Game Development in Paraguay

This is probably the most exciting news. Paraguay now has an IGDA chapter! For those who don't know, IGDA stands for International Game Developers Association. Having a local chapter means we can organize events, share knowledge, and support each other in our game development journeys.

The Paraguayan game industry is small, mainly because the local market is limited. Most successful games need to target international markets, which adds complexity. However, there's a lot of enthusiasm and talent here, and I'm optimistic about the future.

I'm currently serving as secretary for the IGDA Paraguay chapter, and we're planning several events for this year.

## Personal Game Development Projects

I've been working on three projects:

1. **Wolfenstein 3D-style project**: A raycasting engine to learn the fundamentals of OpenGL and 3D graphics. It's been challenging but incredibly educational.

2. **Custom 3D engine**: Following various YouTube tutorials, I've been building a simple 3D engine from scratch. This has taught me so much about how game engines work under the hood.

3. **Commercial multi-platform game**: Using the Cocos2d-x framework, I'm developing a game that could potentially be released commercially. This is the most ambitious of the three projects.

## Blog Plans

I'm planning to write more technical tutorials this year, covering:

- Blender for isometric tile generation
- Photoshop/GIMP automation for creating tilesheets
- Cocos2d-x implementation tips and tricks

I also owe you all a post about one of our college game projects. I'll try to get that out by the end of the month.

As always, I appreciate everyone who reads this. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or just want to chat about game development!
